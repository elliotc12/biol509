Title: Using deep learning to predict passive stimulus viewing using 2-photon calcium imaging data from awake mouse V1
Abstract: I hope to use a feedforward neural network to perform classification on an already-processed 2-photon data set from a mouse passive viewing experiment. The processed dataset represents the firing rate estimate of individual cells at 30ms time intervals, along with the passive stimulus shown to the mouse. I hope to use the keras neural network package to train a feedforward network classifier to predict which of eight stimuli was shown to a mouse given the firing rate of a subset of its V1 neurons. The dataset shows 49 cells for roughly ten frames per stimuli; I will train a network using individual frames, with a 49 dimensional input, and also try to combine the entire neural firing of a stimuli, using a 490 dimensional input.
